# Test data for inference-related tools.

* `infer_eval_discrete_glyphs.jsonl`: First 100 discrete glyph predictions.

* `infer_eval_sketch_only.jsonl`: First 100 predictions from sketch generation.

* `infer_eval_glyph_recognition_from_sketch.jsonl`: First 100 predictions from
  the glyph annotation model that runs over the output of the sketch generation
  model.

* `infer_eval_combined_strokes_and_glyphs.jsonl`: Combined discrete glyph and
  sketch token predictions.
